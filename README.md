# Simple Note-Taking Web App
A lightweight, localStorage-powered note manager built with vanilla JavaScript.

Features
✔ Add Notes – Click the "+" button to create new notes.
✔ Save Notes – Automatically saves to localStorage when:


Clicking the 💾 (save) icon

Deleting a note

# Exiting a textarea (focusout)
✔ Delete Notes – Remove notes with the 🗑️ (trash) icon.
✔ Persistent Storage – Notes reload when you revisit the page.

# How It Works
Uses DOM manipulation to dynamically create notes.

Stores notes as an array of strings in localStorage.

# Event listeners handle save/delete/focusout actions.
Why It’s Useful
✅ No dependencies (pure vanilla JS)
✅ Perfect for learning DOM & localStorage
✅ Easily extendable (add tags, colors, or sync later)
